# Finally

For a long time I wanted to create my personal website but never found the time to do so. It came back up when we started working together with Christian Baumgartner and I saw [his personal website](https://baumgach.github.io/) hosted via GitHub Pages.
Since [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) makes the hosting of a static website painless, at least from a developer perspective, I finally found the motivation to make time to setup my personal website.

# HTML Templates

At first I was only planning on setting up an online CV.
If you also do not want to design your personal website from the ground up, then search for existing HTML templates online is a great way to save a lot of time.
One of the criterias I was looking for was a responsive single page design.
